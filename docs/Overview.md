# *lsa*BGC Suite Overview

lsaBGC consists of several individual programs which provide a broad suite of functions for comparative analysis of 
biosynthetic gene clusters across a single focal lineage or taxa (recommended/tested at species or genus levels), to 
understand the allelic variability observed for BGC genes, and mine for novel SNVs within such genes representative
of previously unidentified allelic variants.

## lsaBGC Programs
lsaBGC comprises of 8 primary programs:
