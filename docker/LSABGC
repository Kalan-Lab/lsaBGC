                Wrapper for running 2 main workflows of the lsaBGC suite within Docker:
		
                - lsaBGC-Easy: Run lsaBGC-Easy for bacterial genomes from a common taxa (e.g. lineage, species or genus).
                             * NOTE: Only works if you have genomes downloaded - e.g. GTDB automatic download part does not work within Docker!
                               The arguments: "-n None" will thus be appended to commands. 
			
                - lsaBGC-Euk-Easy: Run lsaBGC-Easy but specifically designed for fungal [small eukaryotic] genomes (experimental!)

                Usage example:
                ./run_LSABGC.sh lsaBGC-Easy.py -n None -g Directory_of_Genomes_in_FASTA/ -o Results/ -c 10
                ./run_LSABGC.sh lsaBGC-Euk-Easy.py -g Directory_of_Genomes_in_GenBank/ -o Results/ -c 10
		
                ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                KEY NOTES:
                ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                * For lsaBGC-Easy.py (but not lsaBGC-Euk-Easy.py), the -n "None" is currently required.
                * MEME (used in antiSMASH for CASSIS and RODEO) has been manually uninstalled in the antiSMASH conda environment within the 
                  lsaBGC Docker image because it requires a commercial license.
                * For arguments which you would provide quotes for if using the workflows directly, please preceed quotes with a backslash. E.g.:
                 ./run_LSABGC.sh lsaBGC-Easy.py -n \\"None\\" -g Directory_of_Genomes_in_FASTA/ -o Results/ -c 10 -b -bo \\"--include_singletons\\"
		""")
	else:
		os.system(' '.join([x.replace('"', '\\"').replace("'", "\\'") for x in args]))
